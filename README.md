Demonstration of logistic regression in Elm. Also steals a bunch of code from my previous [PCA demo](https://github.com/mg50/pca) for convenience.

# Demo

# Controls

Click around to make blue dots, and shift click to make green dots. Dots can be dragged around with the mouse.

# Future directions

Try using Newton-Raphson instead of gradient ascent.
